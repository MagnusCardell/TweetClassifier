# **Background**

Naive bayes classification is a technique that is based off of bayes theorem of probability. The Bayes classifier is a learning algorithm that works by first collecting the a dataset that it can then convert into a frequency table. Using the frequency of the known data, it can then predict the likelihood of a classification in further evidence. The naive part of the theorem comes from the implication that every event is mutually independent.

P(b|a)=P(a|b)P(a)
